		<h1>How to Play Claryssa's Blackjack</h1>
		<p>The goal of Claryssa's Blackjack is to beat the dealer. To beat the dealer the player must first not bust (go over 21) and second either outscore the dealer or have the dealer bust. Here are the rules of the game.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Claryssa's Blackjack is played with 13 cards (Ace to King) of different suits. The suits do not matter.</li>
			<li>Aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points and face cards count as ten points.</li>
			<li>The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. Except, a "blackjack" is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, and it outranks all other 21-point hands.</li>
			<li>After the players have bet, the dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to himself.</li>
			<li>If the dealer does have a blackjack, then earnings will be lost, unless the player also has a blackjack, which will result in a draw.</li>
			<li>
				<p>The following are the choices available to the player:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Start: To shuffle cards and set bet and earnings to zero.</li>
					<li>Hit: Player draws another card (and more if he wishes). If this card causes the player's total points to exceed 21 (known as "breaking" or "busting") then he loses.</li>
					<li>Stay: Player stays with their cards. If the sum of the cards are greater than the dealer's then the player wins.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If the dealer goes over 21 points, then any player who didn't already bust will win.</li>
			<li>If the dealer does not bust, then the higher point total between the player and dealer will win.</li>
		</ol>
